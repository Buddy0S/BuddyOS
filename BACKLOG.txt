# TODO

Setup emulation: DONE (kinda)
 - Abdullah
 - Kevin
    - Attempting to get kernel to actually run on QEMU
    - something is probably wrong with the stack 
- Marwan
    - setup qemu using realview-a8 following discusion post

Reformatted project directory: DONE
    - Kevin
    - Abdullah

Memory management:
    - Kevin: 
        - Memory sections
        - allocate/deallocate
        - Slab allocator
            - Currently has sizes of 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 bytes each
            - We can change this variably by adjusting the macros for:
                - KERNEL_DYNAMIC (total dynamic memory for kernel)
                - MIN_BLOCK (the smallest block)
                - MAX_BLOCK (the largest block)
                - All of these need to be powers of 2 for alignment and O(1)

PCB:
	- Abdullah:
		- Created Process States with ability to add more states as required
		- Setup PCB struct that has PID, state, stack ptr, and base address of that process
		- Setup stack pointer in start.s
		- Made a context switch function
		- Made a load next context/PCB function
		- Set the top of the stack to where QEMU loads from
		- Created 3 process files that just output a message and then yield
		- Setup yield function
		- Got context switching to actually work, the 3 processes interleave output msgs
            	- Created process table
